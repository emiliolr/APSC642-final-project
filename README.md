# APSC642-final-project

This is the code for my APSC 642 final project at William & Mary, which is focused on replicating basic results in unsupervised outlier detection using a deep autoencoder. The implementation is from scratch and is based on the basic autoencoder and data processing procedures described in ["Unsupervised Outlier Detection via Transformation Invariant Autoencoder"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9376856) (corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wogong/pt-tiae)). The UNet implementation is from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet).
