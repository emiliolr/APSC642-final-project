# APSC642-final-project

This is the code for my APSC 642 final project at William & Mary, which is focused on replicating basic results in unsupervised outlier detection using a deep autoencoder. The implementation is based on the basic autoencoder described in ["Unsupervised Outlier Detection via Transformation Invariant Autoencoder"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9376856).
